                "Our philosophy is to learn from other project's past mistakes to prevent those failures existing on Sanctuary, We want to offer the best possible gameplay experience with a strong community feel. When we look around what is currently offered, what we are trying to provide is unique.",

                "As with many of you, we felt robbed by Blizzard from what they took from us, then attempted to pass off their version of 'vanilla' wow.",
                "We decided to start a vanilla server. Not classic. We use the 2006 version of the game as a guide and aimed to emulate that. Nearly 20 years later, we have the power of retrospection to see what went wrong.",
                "A large community was left with no vanilla options. "

            {"question":"Will there be a cash shop?", "answers":[
                "No, this goes directly against the original game, and we do not believe in adding this as a feature.",
                "There will be an optional donation system for supporting the server hosting costs, however it will have no impact on any gameplay."

            {"question":"How will you handle Cheating/Botting etc.?", "answers":[
                "We believe a vast majority of servers fail due to botting/hacking/etc. The gold of the economy needs to be the tied to players labor. When bots run rampent, the gold supply is now tied to the bots labor. Real players will not be able to keep up and simply will quit.",
                "A vast majority of problems servers deal with is related to botting. GDKP/Boosting for hire is a much lesser problem when the only gold players obtain is earned from their labors. GDKP/RMT ran wild with Classic due to their next to zero effort of stopping botters.",
                "A new approach to this has been developed. We have completely changed how GMs will be able to investigate these reports.",
                "To avoid giving bot developers insight to develop workarounds, I will explain only some of our tooling.",
                "We created a method for GMs to replay any players actions. GMs will be able to go back and watch players actions.",
                "We worked with previous bot developers to write new trigger systems. This has proven to work extremely well.",
                "We have another secret sauce we cannot present publicly, but it will make a BIG difference.",
                "We have also tied account registration to discord. Discord has their own internal anti-spam systems including recaptcha, email verifications, etc. If your IP is flagged as risky to Discord they can require a phone verification. We don't have access to this data, but we can utilize their systems to ensure players are actual players. As well, it opens the option to restrict accounts in the future. If needed, we can restrict account creation to only 'phone verified' accounts for example.",

                "A big part of the MMO experience is working with players. This communication falls apart when there's no mutual language. This is the same reason Vanilla WoW had language options when choosing a realm.",
                "We will be enforcing this via Non-Roman alphabet character filter. However, if we issues arising we can remove this.",
                "We have a mostly hands off approach to speech. Part of the game was the trolling in channels. Remember Blizzard selling the \"I survived Barrens chat\" tshirts? It was a memorable part of the game for many. However there's a big difference between harassment/spam and trolling. If you choose to spam a channel, guild, yell, etc you will be warned or suspended. Racial slurs in chat are not ok either. Although we encourage players to utilize /ignore for players they find annoying, we aren't aiming for a 4chan style of chat in general. There may be conversations that toe the line of acceptable so we keep the right to limit that ultimately."
