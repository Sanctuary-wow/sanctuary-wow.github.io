          "answers": [
            "We believe a vast majority of servers fail in part due to botting, hacking, etc. The economy's gold needs to be tied to real players' labor. When bots run rampant, the gold supply becomes tied to their labor. Otherwise, players will not be able to keep up and may simply quit.",
            "A vast majority of problems that servers deal with are related to botting. GDKP and 'boosting for hire' are lesser problems when gold is obtained through players' labor. GDKP and RMT ran rampant throughout Classic due to their lack of effort to stop botters and RMT.",
            "A new approach to this has been developed. We have changed how GMs will be able to investigate all reports of abusive gameplay.",
            "To prevent bot developers from gaining insight and developing workarounds, we can only explain some of our new tools.",
            "We created a method for GMs to replay any player's actions. GMs will be able to go back and watch players' actions, much like a CCTV system.",
            "We worked with previous bot developers to write new trigger systems. This has proven to work extremely well.",
            "We have another secret sauce that we cannot present publicly, but it will make a big difference.",
            "We have also tied account registration to Discord. Discord has its own internal anti-spam systems, including reCAPTCHA, email verifications, etc. If your IP is flagged as risky to Discord, they can require phone verification. We don't have access to this data, but we can utilize their systems to ensure players are actual players. Additionally, it opens the option to restrict accounts in the future. If needed, we can restrict account creation to only 'phone-verified' accounts, for example.",

            "Part of the MMO experience is working with other players. Communication falls apart when there's no mutual language between players. This is the same reason Vanilla WoW had a language option when choosing a realm.",
            "Enforcing English allows players to communicate with each other instead of multiple languages being used, which can exclude some players. This is detrimental to server cohesion and community building.",
            "We will be enforcing this requirement via an ASCII (English and symbols only) character filter.",
            "We have a mostly hands-off approach to speech. Part of the game was the trolling in channels. Remember Blizzard selling the 'I survived Barrens chat' t-shirts? It was a memorable part of the game for many. However, there is a difference between harassment, spam, and trolling. If you choose to spam a channel, you will be warned or suspended. Racial slurs in chat are not acceptable either. Although we encourage players to utilize /ignore for players they find annoying, we aren't aiming for a 4chan style of chat in general. There may be conversations that toe the line of acceptability, so we will have the final say in what we deem appropriate."
