                "Sanctuary will be a 1x everything Vanilla WoW server, No-Cross faction, No Cash Shop, No sharding, Progressive."
            ]},
            {"question":"Why Should I choose to play on Sanctuary instead of another server?", "answers":[
                "Vanilla's true essence lies in its original rates, game mode, server settings, and zero micro-transactions, allowing you to experience it as intended.", 
                "We have a strong emphesis on combatting RMT, botting, and hacking. This emphesis is unique to a majority of the servers in the past ensuring a long life span.",
                "Our philosophy is to learn from other project's past mistakes to prevent those failures existing on Sanctuary. We want to offer the best possible gameplay experience with a strong community feel. When we look around what is currently offered, what we are trying to provide is unique."

            {"question":"When will Sanctuary release?", "answers":[

            {"question":"What ensures this server will stay running?", "answers":[
                "We started this project so we can all have a stable home to enjoy Vanilla again.",
                "We will have the ability for players to make donations to help with server costs, however we have multiple staff members willing to step up to cover the full cost of the server's lifespan if needed.",
                "For day to to day server operation, we have several redundancy systems to ensure that the server has a 100% uptime",
                "A 24 hour health check script has been developed to notify staff of any system errors"

		"title": "Server Philosophy",
		"questions": [
            {"question":"Is this a 'Classic' server?", "answers":[
                "As with many of you, we felt deceived by Blizzard because of what they took from us, and then released something entirely different.",
                "We decided to start a Vanilla server, not Classic. We are using the 2006 version of the game as a guide and aimed to emulate that. Nearly 20 years later we possess the power of retrospection to see what went wrong.",
                "However, we will be supporting the modern client due to performance issues with the original client. We will ensure this modern client does not provide additional feature not present in the original.",
                "The original client will still be fully supported."
            ]},
            {"question":"Will there be a cash shop?", "answers":[
                "No. This goes directly against the original game, and we do not believe money should have an effect on the game."
            ]},
            {"question":"Will there be additional content added?", "answers":[
                "No, we are following the Vanilla principles."
            ]},
            {"question":"How will you handle Cheating/Botting etc?", "answers":[
                "We believe a vast majority of servers fail in part due to botting, hacking, etc. The gold of the economy needs to be tied to real player's labor. When bots run rampent the gold supply is now tied to the bot's labor. Overwise players will not be able to keep up and simply will quit.",
                "A vast majority of problems that servers deal with are related to botting. GDKP and 'Boosting for hire' is a lesser problem when the gold is obtained through player's labor. GDKP and RMT ran rampent throughout Classic due to their lack of effort to stop botters and RMT.",
                "A new approach to this has been developed. We have changed how GMs will be able to investigate all reports of abusive gameplay.",
                "To prevent bot developers from gaining insight and developing workarounds, I can only explain some of our new tools.",
                "We created a method for GMs to replay any players actions. GMs will be able to go back and watch players actions. Much like a CCTV system.",
                "We worked with previous bot developers to write new trigger systems. This has proven to work extremely well.",
                "We have another secret sauce we cannot present publicly, but it will make a BIG difference.",
                "We have also tied account registration to discord. Discord has their own internal anti-spam systems including recaptcha, email verifications, etc. If your IP is flagged as risky to Discord they can require a phone verification. We don't have access to this data, but we can utilize their systems to ensure players are actual players. As well, it opens the option to restrict accounts in the future. If needed, we can restrict account creation to only 'phone verified' accounts for example.",
                "We also have a strict IP range allowed to be used."
            ]},
            {"question":"Language/Speech Policy", "answers":[
                "The official language of the server is English, which will be enforced in all public channels.",
                "Part of the MMO experience is working with other players. Communication falls apart when there's no mutual language between players. This is the same reason Vanilla WoW had a language option when choosing a realm.",
                "We will be enforcing this requirement via an ASCII (english and symbols only) character filter.",
                "We have a mostly hands off approach to speech. Part of the game was the trolling in channels. Remember Blizzard selling the \"I survived Barrens chat\" tshirts? It was a memorable part of the game for many. However there is a difference between harassment, spam and trolling. If you choose to spam a channel you will be warned or suspended. Racial slurs in chat are not acceptable either. Although we encourage players to utilize /ignore for players they find annoying, we aren't aiming for a 4chan style of chat in general. There may be conversations that toe the line of acceptable so we will have the final say in what we deem appropriate."

                "This restriction will exclude all VPNs",
                "There will be an option to petition for an IP unblock. We will attempt to whitelist valid IP ranges such as Universities"
            ]},
            {"question":"What limitations will the 1.14 client have?", "answers":[
                "We have disabled the add-on communication channel. This decision will break add-ons that rely on this channel. We cannot provide a full list of add-ons that will be effected but we recommend trying out add-on packs for compatability.",
                "This does not mean all add-ons will break. The majority of add-ons will not be affected.",
                "We do this to ensure that there is no advantage to using the modern client over the original. This modern feature was not in Vanilla and we do not believe it has a place here either.",
                "We acknowledge 1.14 allows for additional wall jumping abuse. We have additional triggers, as well as the ability to replay players actions. These malicious actions will be bannable."

                "The server we will have dynamic respawns in the lower level areas during our launch. We feel player population overall will be spread out enough once leveling progresses and will disable dynamic respawn at that time."

            {"question":"Will you be able to complete normal quests in raid groups?", "answers":[
                "No, this is often abused in lower level areas, due to the adjusted dynamic respawn completing any quest other than raid specific quests will be disabled while in a raid group",
                "Although we understand that bottlenecks may arise and it can be annoying, there are other aspects to consider. While waiting you have the opportunity to chat with people, group up in preparation for upcoming quests, encounter the opposite faction, etc. This is part of the game.",
                "This is where you will start to remember players and develop love/hate relationships towards certain players within the game. We believe this to be part of what helps creates both player identity as well as a strong community",
                "Whereas simply raid grouping without talking in order to quickly complete quests may be more efficient, it's bland. It makes the game fast and convenient and removes social interactions."
